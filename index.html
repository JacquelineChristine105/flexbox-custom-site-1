                <p><span>I was born and raised </span>in Northern Alberta, Canada and here my roots run <span>very</span> deep! My heart and soul belongs to the wide-spread forests here, open prairies and blue hills. Alberta will always be my home--even though I reside in Tulum from time to time. I have a flair for travel but my heart will always belong to my home, my husband, and my kitties!</p>

I spend a lot of time doing concentrated work and study--I <span>love</span> learning!!--and nature is always my release back to myself. I'm slowly learning to be more connected, still and present in this ever busy world and it has been a true joy every step of the way.</p>

                <p><span>Fun Fact: I love teaching </span>others! Becoming a teacher has been on my heart for a number of years, but I never knew what exactly I wanted to teach. I'm currently working on a course (of which I CANNOT WAIT to release in 2022) all about the power of finding your passion through conecting to your spiritual center. It's honestly so much fun!</p>
